# NSTool
A twitter link opener written in python, includes discord joiner/link unshortener by [Parotic](https://github.com/parotic0) and [Laurence](https://github.com/laurencebedford)
# About
NSTool was written as hobby project, it was in development for a month but i lost interest in it. So I'm open-sourcing the project incase anybody wants to continue working on it or to steal our features
# Features
* Fast Twitter link opener
* Built in link unshortener
* Auto Discord joiner
* Cool CLI interface
* Saves details to a database (WOW)
* Messy code
# Usage
1) download the py file
2) go through the list of librarys required installing all of them \
WARNING: install 'python-twitter' in pip and not twitter 
3) You need twitter api credentials from the twitter developer panel, you need your api key, api secret, access token, access secret \
aswell as a discord token (search how to find this) 
4) if everything is good you should land in the menu, from here every is straight forward and the program should **hopefully** just work.
